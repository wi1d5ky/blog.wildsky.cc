  <p>
    I&#8217;m using monodevelop to run a project in class, and recently I found that Nunit 3.0.1 make my test not work.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After googling, I finally found a package to slove my problem:
  </p>
  
  <p class="r">
    <strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitTestAdapter.WithFramework/">NUnit TestAdapter including NUnit 2.6.4 framework</a></strong>
  </p>
  
  <p class="r">
    You can found it in your nuget! It works in Visual Studio and Monodevelop!
