I'm using monodevelop to run a project in class, and recently I found that Nunit 3.0.1 make my test not work.

After googling, I finally found a package to slove my problem:

[NUnit TestAdapter including NUnit 2.6.4 framework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnitTestAdapter.WithFramework/)

You can found it in your nuget! It works in Visual Studio and Monodevelop!
