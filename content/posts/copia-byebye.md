I love a app called Copia, and there are also some media introduced it.

But I found it disappear now.

Mercifully, my friend, ettoolong, backuped it before.

And now I decide to shared it to you all.

If you are the ownner of Copia and you don't want it appear here.

Please send an email to me. (wildsky at moztw.org)

Or you could just tweet to @wildskyf
